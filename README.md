# Quick FEA - Godot

This project is intended to be a technical demo of Godot's capabilities for engineering productivity software, invoking a Finite Element library for structural engineering analysis. The long-term goal is to create quality open-source software, suited to use in engineering practice, and extensible for custom use-cases and workflows. Furthermore, the software will be a demonstration of the finite element method for teaching and other academic applications.
